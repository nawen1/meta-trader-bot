## üìä Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```python
from src.kaizen_trading_bot import KaizenTradingBot
from utils.config import get_config

# Initialize unified bot
bot = KaizenTradingBot(account_balance=10000.0)

# Analyze with multi-timeframe data
timeframes_data = {
    '1d': daily_data,     # Higher timeframe context
    '4h': h4_data,        # Confirmation
    '1h': h1_data,        # Entry zone identification  
    '15m': m15_data,      # Precise entry timing
    '5m': m5_data         # Scalping opportunities
}

# Comprehensive analysis
results = bot.analyze_market('EURUSD', timeframes_data)

# Get trading recommendation
recommendation = results['trading_recommendation']
print(f"Action: {recommendation['action']}")
print(f"Direction: {recommendation['direction']}")
print(f"Confidence: {recommendation['confidence']:.2f}")
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
from utils.config import update_config

# Customize for aggressive trading
config = update_config(
    max_risk_per_trade=0.03,        # 3% risk per trade
    min_trap_confidence=0.8,        # Higher trap detection threshold
    strict_htf_priority=True,       # Enforce HTF alignment
    trap_detection_enabled=True     # Enable advanced trap detection
)

bot = KaizenTradingBot(config=config)
```

## üìà Performance Features

### Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Dynamic calculation based on account balance and risk tolerance
- **Trailing Stops**: Automatic stop-loss adjustments to protect profits
- **Multi-Tier Profits**: TP1 (1%), TP2 (2.5%), TP3 (5%) with customizable allocation
- **Daily Limits**: Prevent excessive losses with configurable daily limits

### Signal Quality
- **Confluence Analysis**: Multiple factors must align before signal generation

## üîß Configuration Options

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `max_risk_per_trade` | 2% | Maximum risk per individual trade |
| `max_daily_loss` | 5% | Maximum daily loss limit |
| `fractal_period` | 5 | Period for fractal identification |
| `min_trap_confidence` | 0.7 | Minimum confidence for trap detection |
| `strict_htf_priority` | True | Enforce higher timeframe priority |
| `trap_detection_enabled` | True | Enable advanced trap detection |

## üö¶ Trading Workflow

1. **Higher Timeframe Analysis**: Establish market bias on D1/4H/1H
2. **Structure Assessment**: Identify key levels, fractals, and market character
3. **Trap Detection**: Screen for potential manipulation and unsafe conditions
4. **Entry Refinement**: Find precise entries on lower timeframes (15M/5M)
5. **Risk Calculation**: Size positions and set stops/targets
6. **Execution**: Only trade when all conditions align

## üìã Conflict Resolution

During the merge process, conflicts between overlapping implementations were resolved by:

- **Prioritizing higher-quality code** with better error handling
- **Combining complementary features** rather than duplicating functionality
- **Maintaining backward compatibility** with existing configurations
- **Preserving the strengths** of each individual PR
- **Creating unified interfaces** for consistent usage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Test thoroughly** before using with real capital
- **Start with demo accounts** to validate performance
- **Understand risk management** - trading involves substantial risk
- **Monitor performance** and adjust parameters as needed
- **Keep higher timeframe bias** - never trade against institutional flow
